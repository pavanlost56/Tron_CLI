# CodeInsight: Core Modules

CodeInsight is structured with core modules to handle different functionalities, including interaction with local LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Model Context Protocol (MCP) client, and a command-line interface (CLI).

## Directory Structure

- `cli`: Command-line interface components
- `core`: Core functionality for different modules
- `llm`: Local LLM interactions
- `rag`: Retrieval-augmented generation components
- `mcp`: Model Context Protocol client
- `utils`: Utility functions

Each module serves a specific purpose, allowing CodeInsight to effectively integrate different resources and provide an intelligent codebase assistant.
